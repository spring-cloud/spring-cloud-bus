Spring Cloud Bus works by adding Spring Boot autconfiguration if it detects itself on the classpath. All you need to do to enable the bus is to add `spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp` or `spring-cloud-starter-bus-kafka` to your dependency management and Spring Cloud takes care of the rest. Make sure the broker (RabbitMQ or Kafka) is available and configured: running on localhost you shouldn't have to do anything, but if you are running remotely use Spring Cloud Connectors, or Spring Boot conventions to define the broker credentials, e.g. for Rabbit

.application.yml
----
spring:
  rabbitmq:
    host: mybroker.com
    port: 5672
    username: user
    password: secret

The bus currently supports sending messages to all nodes listening or all nodes for a particular service (as defined by Eureka).  More selector criteria may be added in the future (ie. only service X nodes in data center Y, etc...). There are also some http endpoints under the `/bus/*` actuator namespace.  There are currently two implemented.  The first, `/bus/env`, sends key/value pairs to update each node's Spring Environment.  The second, `/bus/refresh`, will reload each application's configuration, just as if they had all been pinged on their `/refresh` endpoint.

NOTE: The Bus starters cover Rabbit and Kafka, because those are the two most common implementations, but Spring Cloud Stream is quite flexible and binder will work combined with `spring-cloud-bus`.
