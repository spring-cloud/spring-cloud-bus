== Quick Start

include::quickstart.adoc[]

== Addressing an Instance

The HTTP endpoints accept a "destination" parameter, e.g. "/bus/refresh?destination=customers:9000", where the destination is an `ApplicationContext` ID. If the ID is owned by an instance on the Bus then it will process the message and all other instances will ignore it. Spring Boot sets the ID for you in the `ContextIdApplicationContextInitializer` to a combination of the `spring.application.name`, active profiles and `server.port` by default.

== Addressing all instances of a service

The "destination" parameter is used in a Spring `PathMatcher` (with the path separator as a colon `:`) to determine if an instance will process the message.   Using the example from above, "/bus/refresh?destination=customers:**" will  target  all instances of the "customers" service regardless of the profiles and ports set as the `ApplicationContext` ID.

== Application Context ID must be unique

The bus tries to eliminate processing an event twice, once from the original `ApplicationEvent` and once from the queue.  To do this, it checks the sending application context id againts the current application context id.  If multiple instances of a service have the same application context id, events will not be processed.  Running on a local machine, each service will be on a different port and that will be part of the application context id.  Cloud Foundry supplies an index to differentiate.  To ensure that the application context id is the unique, set `spring.application.index` to something unique for each instance of a service.  For example, in lattice, set `spring.application.index=${INSTANCE_INDEX}` in application.properties (or bootstrap.properties if using configserver).

== Customizing the Message Broker

Spring Cloud Bus uses
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream[Spring Cloud Stream] to
broadcast the messages so to get messages to flow you only need to
include the binder implementation of your choice in the
classpath. There are convenient starters specifically for the bus with
AMQP, Kafka and Redis
(`spring-cloud-starter-bus-[amqp,kafka,redis]`). Generally speaking
Spring Cloud Stream relies on Spring Boot autoconfiguration
conventions for configuring middleware, so for instance the AMQP
broker address can be changed with `spring.rabbitmq.{asterisk}`
configuration properties. Spring Cloud Bus has a handful of native
configuration properties in `spring.cloud.bus.{asterisk}`
(e.g. `spring.cloud.bus.destination` is the name of the topic to use
the the externall middleware). Normally the defaults will suffice.

To lean more about how to customize the message broker settings
consult the Spring Cloud Stream documentation.

== Tracing Bus Events

Bus events (subclasses of `RemoteApplicationEvent`) can be traced by
setting `spring.cloud.bus.trace.enabled=true`. If you do this then the
Spring Boot `TraceRepository` (if it is present) will show each event
sent and all the acks from each service instance. Example (from the
`/trace` endpoint):

    "id": "c4d374b7-58ea-4928-a312-31984def293b",
    "origin": "customers:9000",
    "destination": "*:**"
  }
}

This trace shows that a `RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent` was sent from
`customers:9000`, broadcast to all services, and it was received
(acked) by `customers:9000` and `stores:8081`.

To handle the ack signals yourself you could add an `@EventListener`
for the `AckRemoteApplicationEvent` and `SentApplicationEvent` types
to your app (and enable tracing). Or you could tap into the
`TraceRepository` and mine the data from there.

NOTE: Any Bus application can trace acks, but sometimes it will be
useful to do this in a central service that can do more complex
queries on the data. Or forward it to a specialized tracing service.
