Spring Cloud Bus links the nodes of a distributed system with a lightweight message
broker. This broker can then be used to broadcast state changes (such as configuration
changes) or other management instructions. A key idea is that the bus is like a
distributed actuator for a Spring Boot application that is scaled out. However, it can
also be used as a communication channel between apps. This project provides starters for
either an AMQP broker or Kafka as the transport.
